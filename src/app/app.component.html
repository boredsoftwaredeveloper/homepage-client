<h1>Bored Software Developer</h1>
<p>
  This website exists because I got bored, and since I don't enjoy learning
  for the sake of learning, I decided to build something instead.
</p>
<p>
  It's a personal experiment in picking up DSA, system design, and backend
  engineering by overengineering problems that didn't need solutions.

  At worst, time is wasted. At best, skills improve. Either way, boredom loses.
